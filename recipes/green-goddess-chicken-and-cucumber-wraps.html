<p><em>Prep Time: 10 mins | Total Time: 10 mins | Servings: 2 </em></p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
    <li><p> (7 inch) spinach herb tortillas, such as Mission® Carb Balance Tortillas </p></li>

    <li><p> 2 leaf lettuce leaves, washed and completely dried, plus more for serving </p></li>

    <li><p> 2 (1 ounce) slices mozzarella </p></li>

    <li><p> 2/3 cup shredded cooked chicken breast </p></li>

    <li><p> 1 cucumber, peeled </p></li>

    <li><p> 1/2 avocado, thinly sliced </p></li>

    <li><p> 1 thin slice sweet onion, separated into rings </p></li>

    <li><p> 2 tablespoons purchased green goddess salad dressing, such as Kraft® </p></li>

    <li><p> 2 green onion leaves or 2 chives (optional) </p></li>

    <li><p> grape tomatoes, for garnish (optional) </p></li>

</ul>
   
<h2>Steps</h2>

  <ol>
   <li><p>For each wrap, place a tortilla on a flat work surface and cover half the tortilla surface with a piece of leaf lettuce. Top lettuce with 1 mozzarella slice, and distribute 1/3 cup shredded chicken over cheese. </p></li>

   <li><p></p>Cut cucumber in half crosswise. Cut one half into 6 to 8 cucumber spears, and set aside. Use a vegetable peeler to shave remaining half of cucumber into very thin pieces, avoiding seeds. Place 1/2 of shaved cucumber on top of chicken. </p></li>

   <li><p></p>Add half the avocado slices and half the sweet onion rings. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon green goddess dressing. Begin rolling the tortilla from the filled edge to the unfilled edge. Roll wrap in a paper towel to mold. Meanwhile, repeat steps with remaining ingredients for second wrap. </p></li>

   <li><p></p>Release first wrap from paper towel and tie closed with a green onion leaf or chive. Release and tie second wrap.  </p></li>

   <li><p></p>To serve, place wraps on a bed of leaf lettuce. Lettuce leaves may be used for an optional outer wrap. Garnish with reserved cucumber spears and grape tomatoes. </p></li>
</ol>
